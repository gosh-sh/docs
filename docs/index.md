# Overview

**GOSH** â€” **a revolutionary decentralized computing platform** that is accessible to everyone, everywhere.

GOSH runs on the [**Acki Nacki**](acki-nacki/overview.md) protocol, ensuring scalability, fast finality and gasless transactions.

As Git on-chain and [DAO](on-chain-architecture/organizations-gosh-dao-and-smv.md/#dao) platform, GOSH enables communities to reach consensus on decentralized processes and asset management.

Various tools have been developed to assist you in adopting GOSH for your decentralized processes and asset management:

* create and manage your on-chain repositories using the [GOSH Web](https://app.gosh.sh){:target="_blank"} interface or directly in the [Docker Extension](https://hub.docker.com/extensions/teamgosh/docker-extension){:target="_blank"};

* work with an on-chain repository just like you would with a regular Git repository with [Git Remote Helper](working-with-gosh/git-remote-helper.md).


GOSH offers an array of powerful [apps](https://gosh.sh/tools), including:  

* [Integrity Credits](integrity-credits/overview.md): uses DAO in GOSH to provide expert assessments and loans for biodiversity conservation;

* [AnyTree](working-with-gosh/anytree.md): ensures the security of your software supply chain;

* [Hackathons and Grant Programs](hacks-and-grants/overview.md): you can run decentralized hackathons or grant programs directly from your DAO;

GOSH can be used to access other blockchain networks, currently [supporting Ethereum](ethereum-L2/overview.md)  
(Bitcoin is coming soon).
