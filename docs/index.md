<!-- **GOSH** — a Decentralized Cloud to build consensus around your documents. 

A Git on-chain and DAO platform, GOSH offers a suite of ready-to-use embedded applications to write and deploy code, conduct peer reviews, run decentralized [Hackathons and Grant Programs](hacks-and-grants/overview.md), and much more. GOSH is a Public Chain with [Ethereum L2](ethereum-L2/overview.md) cross-chain functionality, built on the groundbreaking [Acki Nacki](https://www.ackinacki.com/){:target="_blank"} consensus protocol, which supports a Freemium business model (gas-free transactions).

# Overview

**GOSH** — a **revolutionary decentralized computing platform** accessible to everyone, everywhere.

GOSH is a blockchain that runs on [**Acki Nacki**](acki-nacki/overview), the groundbreaking consensus protocol that ensures transparency, security, and trust in every transaction. It is free to use.

GOSH enables communities to reach a consensus through the use of [**DAOs**](on-chain-architecture/organizations-gosh-dao-and-smv/#dao) for decentralized processes and asset management.


Various tools have been developed to assist you in working with the DAO.  

* create and manage your on-chain repositories using [GOSH Web](https://app.gosh.sh){:target="_blank"} or directly in the [Docker Extension](https://hub.docker.com/extensions/teamgosh/docker-extension){:target="_blank"}  

* work with on-chain repository as if you use a regular git repository with [Git Remote Helper](working-with-gosh/git-remote-helper.md)


[GOSH applications](https://gosh.sh/tools) can be used to create and manage workflows in the DAO:  
GOSH offers an array of powerful apps, including:  

* [Integrity Credits](integrity-credits/overview.md): uses DAO in GOSH to provide expert assessment and loans for biodiversity conservation;  

* [AnyTree](working-with-gosh/anytree.md): ensures the security of your software supply chain;  

* [Hackathons and Grant Programs](hacks-and-grants/overview.md): you can run decentralized hackathons or grant program directly from your DAO;

and many other.

GOSH can be used to access other blockchain networks. Currently, GOSH is a public chain with [Ethereum L2](ethereum-L2/overview.md) cross-chain functionality.

## Architecture

1. Build a scalable multithreaded, multisharded content addressable blockchain
2. Implement Git using [smart contracts](on-chain-architecture/gosh-smart-contracts.md)
3. Implement [DAO](on-chain-architecture/organizations-gosh-dao-and-smv.md) on top of that Git to allow building consensus around the code
4. Formally verify the smart contracts
5. Represent all entities by hashes (container images, git commits, blobs, pull requests etc.);
6. Allow anyone to add some metadata with signature to any entity;
7. Allow anyone to decide whose metadata to trust;
8. Build chain/tree of trust: dependencies can be organized using the same architecture, and containers built -->

* To ensure the security of your software supply chain, you can use [AnyTree](working-with-gosh/anytree.md). This is a software deployment system that is secured by the blockchain. -->
