<!-- ## **To integrate with GOSH L2, you will need** -->


## **Introduction**

Endpoint for use with [Ever-SDK](https://docs.everos.dev/ever-sdk/){:target="_blank"}

```
network main: https://network.gosh.sh
```

To explore the GOSH blockchain, you can use the [GOSH explorer](https://gosh.live){:target="_blank"}

<!-- TODO change link to contract -->
First you need to get the address of user's profile.  
The contract [**Profile**](contracts.md#profile) is deployed for each user when registering with GOSH.

To get its address, you need to call the method [**`getProfileAddr`**](contracts.md#getprofileaddr) of the [**VersionController**](contracts.md#versioncontroller) contract 

<!-- The result is the address of the user's **Profile** contract. -->


## **Transfer tokens**


### **from GOSH to GOSH**


Before transferring to another TIP-3 wallet, you need to check whether the recipient's TIP-3 wallet is already deployed.

To do this, you need to call the method [**`getWalletAddress`**](contracts.md#getwalletaddress) in the [**RootTokenContract**](contracts.md#roottokencontract), the recipient's public key is specified.

If the recipient's TIP-3 wallet is not deployed, you need to call the method [**`transferToRecipient`**](contracts.md#transfertorecipient) in the TIP-3 wallet contract [**"TONTokenWallet"**](contracts.md#tontokenwallet) (from which the transfer will be made).


!!! example

    ```
    await this.run('transferToRecipient', {
        _answer_id: 0,
        answer_addr: null,
        to: { pubkey, owner: null },
        tokens: 0,
        evers: BigInt(4.5 * 10 ** 9).toString(),
        keep_evers: BigInt(4 * 10 ** 9).toString(),
        deploy: true,
        return_ownership: 0,
        notify_payload: null,
    })
    ```


As a result, an empty TIP-3 wallet will be deployed to the recipient.


!!! Warning
    **It is important to wait until the contract status changes to "Active".**


Then, for transfer the TIP-3 tokens to the user, you need to call the method [**`transfer`**](contracts.md#transfer) in the [**TONTokenWallet**](contracts.md#tontokenwallet) contract.


!!! example

    ```
    await this.run('transfer', {
        _answer_id: 0,
        answer_addr: null,
        to: address,
        tokens: amount.toString(),
        evers: BigInt(4 * 10 ** 9).toString(),
        return_ownership: 0,
        notify_payload: null,
    })
    ```


### **from Ethereum to GOSH**


For transfer tokens to GOSH, you need to call the method:

* for `ETH`: [**`deposit`**](contracts.md#deposit)
* for `ERC20` tokens: [**`depositERC20`**](contracts.md#depositerc20)

in the [**ELOCK**](contracts.md#elock) contract.

Then it is necessary [to calculate the address of the user's TIP-3 wallet in GOSH](l2.md#using-the-users-public-key) and wait the transfer of tokens to the received TIP3 user wallet in GOSH.




### **from GOSH to Ethereum**


To transfer tokens to Ethereum, you will need to call method:

* for `ETH`: [**`burnTokens`**](contracts.md#burntokens)
* for `ERC20` tokens: [**`withdrawERC20`**](contracts.md#withdrawerc20)

    (then to call [**`getERC20Approvement`**](contracts.md#geterc20approvement) to determine the commission that needs to be attached to the withdrawal function call)
    { .ml-params }


in the user contract [**TONTokenWallet**](contracts.md#tontokenwallet)


Then wait for the receipt of tokens to the recipient's Ethereum wallet.

## **Getting the user's TIP-3 wallet address:**

<!-- ## **Getting the TIP-3 wallet address by user name** -->
### **using by user name**

Knowing the address of the user's contract [**Profile**](contracts.md#profile) you call the method [**`getAccess`**](contracts.md#getaccess) in it.

As a result, you get a list of all the user's public keys with their numbers.

!!! warning annotate "Important"
    It is necessary to take the zeroth pubkey from the list

Then, using the received user's public key, it will be possible [to determine the address of the user's TIP-3 wallet](l2.md#using-the-users-public-key)


<!-- ## **Getting the user's TIP-3 wallet address using the user's public key** -->

### **using the user's public key**

To do this, in the [**RootTokenContract**](contracts.md#roottokencontract) calling method [**`getWalletAddress`**](contracts.md#getwalletaddress)  

<!-- 

To do this, in the **RootTokenContract** (1)
{ .annotate }

1.  address

## **Get info about TIP-3 wallet details**

<!-- **************************************** -->
To get information about the TIP-3 wallet you will need to call the [**`getDetails`**](contracts.md#getdetails) method in the contract [**TONTokenWallet**](contracts.md#tontokenwallet)




## **Get TIP-3 root list**


To get a list of ERC20 token addresses that are supported in GOSH Ethereum L2, you need to call the [**`getTokenRoots`**](contracts.md#gettokenroots) method in the [**ELOCK**](contracts.md#elock) contract.

For every ERC20 token in the given list, execute the following get-methods:  
[**`name`**]()
[**`symbol`**]()
[**`decimals`**]()


After that, you need to call the method [**`getRootAddr`**](contracts.md#getrootaddr) in the [**Ð¡hecker**](contracts.md#checker) contract with the received data
