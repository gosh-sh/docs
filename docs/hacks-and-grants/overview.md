# **Overview**


The **"Hacks & Grants"** is the new tool integrated into [**DAOs**](../on-chain-architecture/organizations-gosh-dao-and-smv.md#dao) on **GOSH** which allows any DAO to create its own [**Hackathon**](user-guide.md#hackathon) or [**Grant Program**](user-guide.md#grant-program) of any size directly from their decentralized repository

<!-- TODO open after implementation -->
<!-- Hacks & Grants include an automated reward system, allowing users to  tailor their Hacks & Grants program to include any format, be it dollars, euros, pound sterling, Bitcoin, Ether, ERC-20, or DAO tokens. Users can also bring different sponsors to their Hackathon, and the Hacks & Grant program supports multi-token reward pools -->

Hacks & Grants will soon include an automated reward system that allows users to adapt their Hacks & Grants program to any format, be it dollars, euros, pounds, bitcoins, ether, ERC-20 or DAO tokens(*supported*). Users can also invite different sponsors to their Hackathon. Planned in the Hacks & Grant program supports multi-token reward pools

All code, files, and results stored in decentralized open source code repositories, meaning all Hackathon rules are automatically enforced on-chain, and in a trustless environment

Grants on GOSH allow collaborative problem-solving events to be financed, and so sustained, for a longer period of time *(coming soon)*
