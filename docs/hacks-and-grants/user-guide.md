### **Expert Tags**

<!-- TODO
remove into settings & remame KARMA tags-->

Expert Tags are created as evidence of the member's expertise and experience within this DAO.  

By creating and attaching Tags to DAO members, you can count on their skills and experience to help other members of the DAO.

Tags affect the number of votes that the expert will be able to use when voting.

!!! info

    If a DAO member has an attached Expert Tag, then when voting, he will be able to use tokens within his Karma, increased by the coefficient specified when creating this Tag.

Tags will make it easier to find a performer to complete a Task or review it.

Using expert tags when judging at Hackathons will allow you to take into account the weight of each expert's vote when voting for projects, which reduces the likelihood of a subjective impact of each expert's assessment on the final result and reduces the possibility of manipulation by the jury, i.e. judging will be more objective and independent of each other.

If you want to add expert Tags to your DAO simply go to the **Settings** tab in the **karma Tags** section and enter the name of the Tag in the appropriate field. 

You can also specify the percentage by which the karma of the relevant expert will be increased when voting. It's important to note that the experts of the jury must be participants of the DAO before the Hackathon begins.

To delete a Tag, click on the cross in the corresponding line.

The addition of expert Tags can only be made possible through the voting of the DAO members. Therefore, you must leave a comment for the proposal and then click on the **Save changes and create proposal** button to initiate the process.

![](../images/H&G_hacks_expert_tags_1_new_tag.jpg)

You will redirected to the event page in the DAO tab. Now you can proceed with voting.

![](../images/H&G_hacks_expert_tags_2_proposal.jpg)

Any changes to the karma Tags of the DAO will be accepted through the vote.

After the proposal is accepted, on the "Members" tab, you have the ability to assign Expert Tags to DAO members based on their experience.

To assign Expert Tags to DAO members based on their experience, you'll need to navigate to the **Members** tab. 

Once there, you can select the appropriate Tag from the drop-down list and assign it to the respective member.  
This is a great way to highlight the skills and expertise of your DAO members and make it easier for others to identify who to turn to for specific tasks or advice.

Please make sure to include a detailed description of the proposal regarding changes in allowances for members.  
It is important to provide all the necessary information for members of DAO to make informed decisions making the voting process.

Then click on the **Save changes and create proposal** button:

![](../images/H&G_hacks_expert_tags_3_members.jpg)

You will redirected to the event page in the DAO tab. Now you can proceed with voting.

![](../images/H&G_hacks_expert_tags_4_vote_karma_tags.jpg)

Expert Tags will be assigned to DAO members after the proposal is accepted and they will be able to use them for work.
