High Integrity Biodiversity Credits developed by rePLANET using the Wallacea Methodology are the highest grade credits currently available.

[**Integrity Credits**](https://www.integritycredits.com) is a platform for biodiversity projects, their review, credit issuance, and registry.

Collaborating with [**GOSH**](https://app.gosh.sh) provides a comprehensive solution for the platform, guaranteeing the security and integrity of the entire value chain through decentralized peer review, reliable loan issuance, advanced registration service, and flexible trading opportunities.

Governance on the platform is carried out through a **decentralized autonomous organization ([**DAO**](https://docs.gosh.sh/on-chain-architecture/organizations-gosh-dao-and-smv/#dao))** on the blockchain. It facilitates transparent information sharing on the design, measurement, and issuance of biodiversity credits, promoting open and accountable governance.
