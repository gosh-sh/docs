By delivering 3 blocks per second on one thread, with an unlimited number of possible threads, Acki Nacki can sustain, at under 1 second finality, an infinite number of transactions per second — directly proportional to the amount of computing power that exists in the world — making it the only true solution for scalability on the blockchain. 

GOSH is building a decentralized world computer which needs a decentralized backend that can power any cloud service, providing access to databases, and empowering high usage applications, stored entirely on the blockchain. Now this is possible on GOSH. Acki Nacki also offers higher security guarantees than Bitcoin — Not just that, but the probability of a comet hitting the planet Earth and destroying life as we know it, is higher than the probability that Acki Nacki will be broken.
