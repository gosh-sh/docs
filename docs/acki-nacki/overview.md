<!-- By delivering 3 blocks per second on one thread, with an unlimited number of possible threads, **Acki Nacki** can sustain, at under 1 second finality, an infinite number of transactions per second — directly proportional to the amount of computing power that exists in the world — making it the only true solution for scalability on the blockchain. 

GOSH is building a decentralized world computer which needs a decentralized backend that can power any cloud service, providing access to databases, and empowering high usage applications, stored entirely on the blockchain. Now this is possible on GOSH. 

**Acki Nacki** also offers higher security guarantees than Bitcoin — Not just that, but the probability of a comet hitting the planet Earth and destroying life as we know it, is higher than the probability that **Acki Nacki** will be broken. -->

The use cases enabled by GOSH demand so great an amount of data to be processed, that no blockchain technology today can actually cope with handling it entirely on-chain. Consequently, there is a need for a new blockchain architecture that will allow GOSH to do what cloud computing can do.

We present to your attention the **Acki Nacki** consensus algorithm, the innovative blockchain design and
technology for data exchange and replication. .

It will allow faster finality, more throughput, and higher security than any other blockchain consensus algorithm.

By delivering 3 blocks per second on one thread, with an unlimited number of possible thread, **Acki Nacki** will be able to support an infinite number of transactions per second with completion in less than 1 second — directly proportional to the amount of computing power available in the world — making it the only true solution for scalability on the blockchain.

<!-- Acki Nacki is a multi-core, multi-threaded execution environment where anyone can deploy a contract and execute many operations in parallel with under 1 second finality. -->


The **Acki Nack is a multi-core** processor that is also **self-tuning**.

Participants periodically agree on the level of network security they want to achieve by changing its parameters, for example, the number of participants.

And it reacts to these changes and adjusts its properties in accordance with the security guarantees of the entire network.
