The use cases enabled by GOSH demand so great an amount of data to be processed, that no blockchain technology today can actually cope with handling it entirely on-chain. Consequently, there is a need for a new blockchain architecture that will allow GOSH to do what cloud computing can do.

We present to your attention the **Acki Nacki** is an asynchronous highly effective proof-of-stake protocol optimized for fast finality while allowing for high throughput via execution parallelization. It is a probabilistic protocol which achieves higher Byzantine fault tolerance than Bitcoin, BFT or other modern consensus protocols.

Our protocol reaches consensus in two communication steps with probabilistic dynamically adjusted safety guarantees. We trade off deterministic consensus with theoretical constraints on message complexity and number of byzantine agreements with probabilistic algorithms overtaking these boundaries. We further claim that because of the use of randomness and social-economics in blockchain designs, no real trade off is actually present.

One of the key ingredients of our approach is separating the verification of execution by a consensus committee from the attestation of the block propagation by network participants.

Acki Nacki consensus committee is randomly selected for each block and is not predetermined while the Leader is deterministic.
