## **Working with DAO Members**



### __Adding Members to DAO__


Membership in the DAO can be obtained in several ways.

The user can be invited to the DAO using a [special form](members.md#adding-by-gosh-username-or-e-mail) or by an [invitation link](members.md#invite-by-link).

Also, the user can independently [create a membership request](members.md#request-dao-membership) in the DAO.

!!! info
    Adding a member to the DAO is possible only through an proposal.


*Depending on the chosen path, tokens and Karma will be distributed immediately after acceptance proposal, or additional proposals will need to be created for this.*


#### <u>Adding by GOSH username or e-mail</u>


A DAO member can create a proposle to add GOSH user into the DAO.

To do this, go to the tab **Members** in the section **Invite user to DAO**.

* If you know the GOSH username, then enter it.

* If you don't know the name or the user doesn't have a GOSH account yet, enter their email address.


!!! info
    The email address will change to the GOSH username if the user has given permission during registration so that it can be found by email.

Offer the amount of karma for him and please comment your decision.

    You can send an invitation proposal to several users at once.
