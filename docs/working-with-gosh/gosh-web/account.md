<!-- [GOSH Web](https://app.gosh.sh/){:target="_blank"} implements GOSH repository management as a simple web interface.

You will be able to create your **GOSH Account** and [**Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**](../../on-chain-architecture/organizations-gosh-dao-and-smv.md), set up and manage repositories. Repositories stored in GOSH can then be interacted with like any regular remote repository, with a few small configurations to git, making decentralized code management easily available to anyone. -->


<!-- Using the [GOSH Web interface](https://app.gosh.sh/){:target="_blank"}, you can easily organize all the necessary components for your project in a [**Repository**](gosh-web/repository.md) inside your [**Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**](../../on-chain-architecture/organizations-gosh-dao-and-smv.md).

First, you need to create your *GOSH Account** and DAO. -->


To manage your projects in a decentralized way using the [**DAO**](../../on-chain-architecture/organizations-gosh-dao-and-smv.md), you will need to organize all the necessary components in a [**Repository**](./repository.md) on GOSH.

**But to get started, you need to create your GOSH Account.**

## __Create Account__

To start registering on GOSH, simply visit the [**GOSH website**](https://app.gosh.sh){:target="_blank"} and click **Create account**:
