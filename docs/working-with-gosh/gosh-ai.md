# **GOSH.AI**


## **Overview**

GOSH.AI will help you simplify the workflow of writing code.

!!! info
    GOSH.AI only supports code for asynchronous Solidity at the moment


Now one person with technical knowledge can manage and deliver complex software in very little time.

GOSH.AI will create all project files in the repository on the blockchain and write code, tests and deploy scripts.

The generated code is immutable, has timestamps and is stored in a decentralized way.
