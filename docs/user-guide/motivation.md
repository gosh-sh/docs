The Software Supply Chain is a high-impact area. Yet there exists a distinctive lack of secure, trustless, verifiable, and transparent delivery of source code/binaries to developers and users in all software fields. Storing your code on a git means it has an owner, a single point of control, which leads to security vulnerabilities. Currently there is no industrial solution available that is not centralized and thus not dependent on the decisions of a few actors. The main way in which GOSH solves this issue is through allowing developers to build consensus around their code, so the more code is written, the more secure it becomes.
